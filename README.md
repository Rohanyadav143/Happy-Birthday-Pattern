# Happy-Birthday-Pattern
It's a pattern of structure HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
For this code I have only used basic C language and Logic to print that pattern.
In this code you can replace that character with any character and that will be used in the pattern while printing.
It can be created by many way but this is the way what I had uesd for printing this pattern.
